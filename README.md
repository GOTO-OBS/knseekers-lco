## Documentation
Instructions on how to use the notebooks and codes in this repository can be found under the `docs` folder.

## Installation
We highly recommend using the pre-built Google Colab environment to run the pipeline and any other analysis. We have tested this extensively, and are best able to maintain the project in this way. You can of course download everything yourself and run locally (see below) but we can only provide limited support for doing this.

**Note:** Google Colab doesn't store your data by default - be sure to download any outputs you've created before logging out.
