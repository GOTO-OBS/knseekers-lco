## Documentation

This folder contains documentation on how to get started with the Kilonova Seekers - LCO: STAR project, in which you will be involved in transient science from discovery, to observation and analysis. 

Please start by following the instructions to join the dedicated Slack workplace if you haven't already, then proceed to learn how to download the data from the LCO archive.

Once you've downloaded the data using the tutorial provided here, please open the `notebooks` folder to continue, starting with the `pipeline` tutorial.

We'll add more documentation here, as questions arise, and time allows.

If you need any help, you can contact the team on the dedicated Slack workplace.
