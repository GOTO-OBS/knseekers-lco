# Notebooks
This folder contains notebooks for reducing, plotting, and analysing data from LCO.

## Aside: what is a notebook?
Scientists make extensive use of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org), a [literate computing](https://guides.nyu.edu/datascience/literate-prog) environment that lets you run code, display images and videos, write explanations and documents in a flexible, human-readable manner.
