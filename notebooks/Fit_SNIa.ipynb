In theory, this should work for any SN Ia observed by LCO, as long as you reduce the data through the STAR pipeline notebook. To fit lightcurve data well using the models described here, you will ideally need at least 5 epochs of data (5 different observation times) in at least 2 filters (ideally g and r bands). \n\nIf you have any issues, please ask for help on the STAR slack!\n\nThis is notebook inspired by the hubble constant tutorials by David Jones.
