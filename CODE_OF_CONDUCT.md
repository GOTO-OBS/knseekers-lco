## Kilonova Seekers - LCO: STAR Code of Conduct 

The Kilonova Seekers team is committed to making this project productive and enjoyable for everyone. We will not tolerate harassment in any form.

  
As an extension of a Zooniverse project, we expect you to follow the general [Zooniverse Talk community standards](https://www.zooniverse.org/talk/14/672147). Additionally, we ask that you follow the following guidelines:

  

-   Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. Harassment includes sustained disruption, sexual attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography (including screenshots) or recording without consent. It also includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, race or religion.
    
-   All communication should be appropriate for a general audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual or sexist language and imagery is not appropriate.
    
-   Be kind to others. Be respectful and do not insult or put down others. Critique ideas not people.
    
-   Discretion should be used when posting any content to social media sites. If participants wish to share photos on social media, we strongly recommend that they first get the team’s permission.
    

  

Any participant who wishes to report a violation of this policy is asked to message, in confidence, one of the designated points of contact: Lisa Kelsey or Tom Killestein. If asked to stop inappropriate behaviour, participants are expected to comply immediately and may be asked to leave the project.
